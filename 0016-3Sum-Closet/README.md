# 0016 3Sum Closet

Given an array nums of n integers and an integer target, find three integers in nums 
such that the sum is closet to target. return the sum of the three integers. You may
assume that each input would have exactly one solution

Examples:

Given array nums = [-1,2,1,-4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closet to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
