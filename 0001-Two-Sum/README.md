# Two Sum
  Given an array of integers, return <b>indices</b> of the two numbers such that they add up
to a specific target.
  You may assume that each input would have exatcally one soltion, and you may not use the same
  element twice;
Example
   Given numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return[0,1]
